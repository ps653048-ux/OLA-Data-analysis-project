This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride data using SQL and Power BI to extract meaningful business insights. 

📊 Ola Data Analysis Project (SQL + Power BI)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis case study based on Ola ride data. The main objective is to extract meaningful business insights by combining SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The project simulates a real-world analytics workflow used in data analyst roles.

🗂️ Data Workflow & Methodology

Data Upload & Storage (SQL)

1) The raw Ola dataset was first uploaded into a SQL database.
2) Tables were structured properly to ensure data consistency and ease of querying.
3) This step mimics real-world scenarios where analysts work with data stored in relational databases.


Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL)

1) Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent records.
2) Used SQL queries to transform raw data into analysis-ready forma
Applied filtering, grouping, joins, subqueries, and aggregations to solve business-related SQL problems.
