# OLA-Data-analysis-project
This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride data using SQL and Power BI to extract meaningful business insights. 

📊 Ola Data Analysis Project (SQL + Power BI)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis case study based on Ola ride data. The main objective is to extract meaningful business insights by combining SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The project simulates a real-world analytics workflow used in data analyst roles.

🗂️ Data Workflow & Methodology

Data Upload & Storage (SQL)

1) The raw Ola dataset was first uploaded into a SQL database.
2) Tables were structured properly to ensure data consistency and ease of querying.
3) This step mimics real-world scenarios where analysts work with data stored in relational databases.


Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL)

1) Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent records.
2) Used SQL queries to transform raw data into analysis-ready forma
Applied filtering, grouping, joins, subqueries, and aggregations to solve business-related SQL problems.
SQL Analysis & Business Questions
3) SQL Analysis & Business QuestionsoAnalyzed ride patterns such as total rides, completed vs cancelle
4) Extracted insights related to revenue trends, customer behavior, and driver performance.
5) Focused on writing optimized and readable SQL queries to answer real business questions.

Data Loading into Power BI

1) Cleaned and processed SQL data was imported directly into Power BI.
2) Established proper relationships between tables for accurate reporting.
3) Ensured data integrity during the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
4) Dashboard Development (Power BI)
Built interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and KPIs.
5) Used charts, slicers, and filters to enable dynamic analysis.
6) Designed dashboards to be simple, insightful, and business-friendly.
